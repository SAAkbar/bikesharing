# bikesharing

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to see if having a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In order to check this we opted to use data from a bike-sharing program in New York City for the month of August in 2019. First we had to change the tripduration column to have it properly formatted and to do this we had to use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. After the data was properly formated we were able to use Tableau as a visualization tool to help see if having a bike-sharing program in Des Moines was indeed a solid business proposal.

1. We checked the type of customer which of the 2,344,224 rides, 1,900,359 were subscribers and 443,865 are customers

2. We also checked the Peak Hours, of which 5pm-7pm seemed to be the peak hour of riding

3. We also checked to see how many times a bike was used to see if it needed repairs. and the most a bike was used was 479 times with the least being 1

4. We then checked the checkout times and it showed that majority of the rides were under 20 mins and all most all were under an hour

5. After that we looked at to see the checkout times by gender which showed the same thing but you can also see that majority of the riders are male

6. Next we looked at the Peak hours by day and this shows that during the weekday the peak hours are for 8am-10am and 5pm-7pm while on the weekend its 10am-7pm

7. After that we check Peak Hours by day by gender and this showed that male and female have the same peak hours but unknown does not have any peak hours on a weekday

8. Lastly, we checked the types of users by day by gender and from this we can see that male subscribers are most likely to use it throughout the week.

## Summary

After looking at the Tableau visualization we saw that more that 3/4 of the base were subscribers who on the weekday used the program to go to and from work. The does help erase the fear that most of the users were regular customers as New York City in August could tend to have a lot of tourist which Des Moines can not say the same. Also with this data we can improve on what New York did and add incentives as we know who and when to target them, a couple of ideas could be discount for females as majority of New Yorks riders seem to be male, or we can lower the price on Wednesdays as that seemed to have the lowest peak hours for both males and females. Finally, we could make this even better by adding two more visualization, type of subscriber by age and gender and peak hours by day by age and gender, with these we could also check to see if we should target special promotions for kids or seniors and by their gender to increase the profit flow for the new program in Des Moines.
